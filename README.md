# Mined_Hackathon
The proposed methodologies include a pretrained U-2 Net and subsidiary ensemble networks, the model functions on the latest TensorFlow and Numpy versions. This Repository acts as the final submission of team DetrousEN for the MineD Hackathon.
The task revolved around segmentation with the primary aim being segmenting the background and foreground.

A python package is also developed with command-line functionalities, which accelerates the testing strategies and also enables a rapid deployment experience.

The folder Ensemble contains the Jupyter notebook associated with the ensemble networks where the 'AND' function is used as a conjunction approach between the underlying encoders. The enseble network consists of a SqueezeUnet, UNet, U-2 Net, and U-2 Net plus.
For the tests on the 256 images, a standard U-2 Net is proposed, and the obtained segmented images are available at "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nX8PM-ECYulucVZ16eEtvKVDzP7Z38FW?usp=sharing".

All the pretrained networks are available at "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CT7rw7tyGVCazT-ij9rAnLCBM7s_o-Ax".

Video presentation for the same is avaliable at "https://drive.google.com/file/d/191g1C5dR_vzgLjzUJX5XhhnoUbUn-KqE/view?usp=sharing".
